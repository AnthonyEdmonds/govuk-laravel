# Pagination

Allow users to navigate through a paginated list of information, such as in a table.

```html
<x-govuk::pagination
    label="Related table label"
    :paginator="$results->pagination"
/>
```

Three types of paginator are provided:

* Length aware
* Simple
* Stacked

Each type has been designed to work with Laravel's `AbstractPaginator` classes, such as those retrieved from Eloquent queries.

You should use the:

* Length aware paginator with large result sets when possible
* Simple paginator with sets of information that have no fixed length, or are too expensive to calculate as a fixed set
* Stacked for simple forward and backward page navigation
